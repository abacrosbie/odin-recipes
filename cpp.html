        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>A bunch of pasta</li>
            <li>fajita seasoning (schwartz is best)</li>
            <li>as much cheddar as you can handle</li>

            <li>veggies are for the weak</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your pasta to cook in a hella salty pot of water, as salty as the atlantic as they say</li>
            <li>Chop up the pork chops</li>
            <li>Douse the pork in fajita seasoning, be careful too much and the intense flavour makes it SPICY, but don't be a wuss</li>
            <li>Cook those little porky pieces in a pan/pot/wok/vessel of choice in your favourite lubricant</li>
            <li>Admire the fond (the burnt bits if you over did it)</li>
            <li>Once the pasta has cooked, add to the pan and reserve some pasta water, we're not animals here</li>
            <li>Add the pasta water to the pot to finish cooking the pasta off</li>
            <li>Stir through both cheeses</li>
            <li>Bon appetite</li>
        </ol>
