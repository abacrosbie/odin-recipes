        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef massaman curry is a famous Thai beef stew that is the best of 2 worlds - 
            it has the texture of stew with the flavor of curry. The sauce is intensely savory, 
            thick, and luscious. Make sure you are using a good-quality curry paste (like Maesri) 
            so you will get great depth of flavor without a lot of work.</p>
